# How will Cyanobacteria and Diatoms respond to yearly temperature fluctuations? A study case of coastal Panama and Colombia.

## Introduction y objetivos

Given a scenario where there is a tendency for global change in temperature due to human activity that shows no sign of ceasing its influence, we need to consider the impact that this will have on the biogeochemical cycles. Since primary production by the hands of phytoplankton plays such a large role in mobilizing and introducing organic matter to the marine ecosystems, understanding how different communities and types of photosynthetic organisms might react to a change in global conditions is of vital importance for estimating the consequences of future events. In particular, diatoms and cyanobacteria are known to profit from cold and warm temperatures respectively, making them an ideal subject of study.
The objective of this research is to infer wheter different communities of phytoplankton will be significantly affected by changes in sea temperature in the coasts of Panama and Colombia, given the upwelling conditions that take place in the Gulf of Panama, which should favour the proliferation of phytoplankton. Colombia specifically is also affected by the event of El Niño, which will be considered in our findings. The study will also offer insight on the possible competition between growing populations of cyanobacteria and diatoms, and how the modulation of limiting nutrients affects them. 

## Objetive
The objective of this research is to compare the response of different communities of phytoplankton to the events of El Niño and La Niña in the coasts of  of Panama and Colombia. The study will also offer insight on thecompetition between populations of cyanobacteria and diatoms, and how the availability of limiting nutrients affects them. 

## Discution
For cold conditions, competence between diatoms and cyanobacteria is observed by means of an inverse correlation. For warm conditions however, there appears to be no correlation between the two groups. This latter result can be explained if we consider that cyanobacteria as a whole seem to amount to a lesser fraction of phytoplankton compared to diatoms in the area surrounding the gulf of Panama (citar), meaning that while warm conditions might handicap diatoms, cyanobacteria are not prominent enough to take over as the main phytoplanktonic taxa.

During the year of 2010 we observe a linear correlation between the proportions of the two nutrients, which we can attribute to colder conditions favoring the mixing of the water column, which would mean the renewal of both nutrient proportions in surface water. Diatoms make use of both iron and nitrate, which likewise explains the observed correlation. For the year 2015 though, no correlation appears present and the data reveals low proportion of both nutrients for its duration. This can not only be explained by warm conditions not being ideal for the renewal of nutrient quantities, but also by the implication that in the particular case of the colombian and panamanian Pacific Ocean, no phytoplanktonic group might dominate during warm conditions.

With regards to iron, diatoms show some direct correlation that is accentuated by cold conditions, by which we can confirm that uptake of iron by diatoms takes place. Cyanobacteria show linear correlation during warm conditions, as expected, but appear to have a reverse correlation for the 2010 data, strangely enough. This we could attribute to the uptake of iron by dominating diatoms during the cold conditions, which not only seem to be more prominent in the selected area, but also have demonstrated superior ability for iron assimilation (citar).

As for nitrate, diatoms exhibit strong correlation, which again is more notable for the 2010 data due to colder temperatures that favor them, this being expected. Cyanobacteria on the other hand display inverse correlation during cold conditions, likely due to the dominance of diatoms, but no correlation for the 2015 data, with these two results allowing us to discard the influence of potential diazotrophic cyanobacteria in this study.

## Conclutions
One fact to take into acccount is that the year 2010, while we can assume to be a cold period as a whole, actually comprised conditions both above and below the standard, which could affect our data in one way or another. The duration of events like La Niña in recent doesn't allow for easy selection of a full year period of cold temperatures. Still, our results allow for interesting observations.
In the case of the colombian and panamanian Pacific Ocean, diatoms appear to be the dominant phtoplanktonic taxa, as shown by (cita). In the area of study, no particular taxa appears to be dominant during warm conditions, possibly due to a combination of low cyanobacteria proportions in phytoplankton and diatom inhibiton by high temperatures. Even so, cyanobacteria still exhibit an ability to thrive when temperatures increase, which is to note for the possible effects of climate change in the future.
